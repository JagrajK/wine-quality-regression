In this project we will train two models on the UCI Wine Quality Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). Both models will be predicting the quality score of wines, given the other variables and the colour of the wine. We will first perform an OLS linear regression, and then train an artificial neural network, before comparing the two.
